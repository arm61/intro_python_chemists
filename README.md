This is an open-source project to develop an introductory textbook covering all aspects of Python programming for chemistry students (or all career positions). 

If you would like to be involved, please look at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/intro_python_chemists/blob/master/content/contributing.md).

## On coding style

In this book we prioritise readibility and understandability of code over everything else. 
Therefore, the code herein will **not** necessarily adhere to PEP8 or any other standard, in particular if it sacrifices the educational utility of the material. 
**All** issues opened that are based purely on standard adherence **will** be closed without considering.
However, we are open to issues and pull requests that discuss/improve coding style **if** the focus is on making the code clearer for the learner.
