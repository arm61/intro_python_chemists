## On coding style

In this book we prioritise readibility and understandability of code over everything else. 
Therefore, the code herein will **not** necessarily adhere to PEP8 or any other standard, in particular if it sacrifices the educational utility of the material. 
**All** issues opened that are based purely on standard adherence **will** be closed without considering.
However, we are open to issues and pull requests that discuss/improve coding style **if** the focus is on making the code clearer for the learner.
