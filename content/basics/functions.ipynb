    "\n",
    "A function is defined using the keyword `def`, which tells the Python interperator that in that line you will be giving a function name followed by a set of brackets, some arguments (although these are not essential), and a colon. \n",
    "The function name *needs* to be a single continuous string of characters with no whitespace between them, a common convention is to use the `_` (underscore) character to denote where there should be a space. \n",

    "\n",
    "The number of arguments that a function may have can be anything from 0 to infinity (although that is obviously impractical). \n",

    "You may read this last point and roll your eyes, however I promise you that code you write today will not stay present in your memory forever. \n",

    "Using a standard style of docstring is useful when writting large software packages, due to the availablity of tools to automatically generate software documentation from these docstrings.\n",
    "The Google style indicates the arguments with the keyword `Args`, before listing the arguments, the expected type and a short description (we find that it can be helpful to include information about the expected units in this section). \n",

    "A variable that is created inside a function **cannot** be used elsewhere in your program, this includes the arugment variables. \n",
    "However, it is possible to make use of a variable defined outside of a function within it, just remember that a piece of Python code is parsed from top-to-bottom so the variable needs to be defined **before** the function. \n",
