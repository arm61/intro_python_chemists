In order to ensure a consistent style throughout, we aim to adhere to the following:

- The use of first-person (plural when including the reader) throughout
- Asides should mark use of the markdown indentent quote style
- The `code` style is reserved for Python code, pseudo code should be written in italics
- Equations should be centre-aligned with the `$$ y = x $$` math style
- Comments should be above the line that they are relevant to and should typically be no more than 80 characters long such that they do not overrun the box width (multi-line comments are allowed)
- Placeholder code cells should be marked with the text `# Write your code here`
